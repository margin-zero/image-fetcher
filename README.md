# puzzle-HTML5-JS
JavaScript based puzzle game.

Choose one of images and solve 48 piece puzzle. You can add new images to your game - just put them into "/puzzle" folder and add new filename to "puzzleArray" variable in first line of JS code (file:  "/js/puzzle-html5-js.js"). All images are scaled and resized to fit 800x600 (pixels) puzzle resolution, so don't worry if your image is not exactly this size.

Have fun :)
